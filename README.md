This is a personal portfolio webpage I built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills as a web developer, fitness instructor, and content creator.
The design features a sleek, responsive layout with a fixed navigation bar, hero section, and smooth scroll effects.
It also includes a back-to-top button and a call-to-action for downloading my resume. The page is styled with modern CSS techniques, including custom scrollbars and hover effects. 
Take a look at the code to see how I bring my passions to life on the web! 🌐💻💪
